# FSA-test
I study finite state automaton.<br>
Although it is a basic FSA, it sometimes causes errors.<br>
So I would appreciate it if you could help me.<br>
Probably, but I think this code will help you learn some basic knowledge of FSA.<br>

# What is FSA(finite state automaton)?

Finite State Automaton (FSA) is one of the important concepts in computational theory. Simply put, it is a model consisting of a finite number of states and transition rules between states.<br>
<br>
Specifically, it consists of the following three elements.
<br>
a finite set of states<br>
Set of inputs (alphabet)<br>
Transition function (rules that determine the next state)<br>
FSA determines whether to "accept" or "not accept" a given input column. In other words, a language (a set of strings) that can be recognized is defined.
<br><br>
FSA plays an important role in many areas of computer science.
<br>
For example, it is used when dealing with issues such as compilers and pattern matching. It is also applied in digital circuit design.
<br>

Although FSA has limited computational power, it is theoretically important due to its simplicity, and is a basic concept that is used in various practical fields. Further developed concepts include pushdown automata and Turing machines.
